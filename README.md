### Hello stranger ðŸ‘‹, lffloyd here!

I'm a software developer and undergraduate computer science student at Universidade Federal Fluminense. I love building new things, and my main interests are software engineering, algorithms and machine learning. In my spare time, I love listening to music (of many kinds), reading books and watching movies. Feel free to send me a message if you want, buddy!
